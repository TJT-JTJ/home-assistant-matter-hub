# Robot Vacuum

Robot vacuums are exposed as Matter **Robotic Vacuum Cleaner** devices with the following capabilities:

- **On/Off** - Start and stop cleaning
- **RVC Operational State** - Current state (idle, running, docked, error)
- **RVC Run Mode** - Cleaning modes including room-specific cleaning
- **Service Area** - Room selection for Apple Home (Matter 1.4)
- **RVC Clean Mode** - Cleaning type selection (Sweeping, Mopping, etc.)
- **Power Source** - Battery level (if available)

## Server Mode (Recommended for Apple Home & Alexa)

:::{important}
**Apple Home and Alexa do not properly support bridged robot vacuums.** They require the vacuum to appear as a **standalone Matter device**, not as part of a bridge.

If your vacuum shows "Updating" in Apple Home, doesn't respond to Siri commands, or isn't discovered by Alexa, you need to use **Server Mode**.
:::

### What is Server Mode?

Server Mode exposes a single device as a **standalone Matter device** instead of a bridged device. This is required because:

- Apple Home doesn't support Siri voice commands for bridged RVCs
- Alexa doesn't discover bridged RVCs at all
- The vacuum shows "Updating" or "Not Responding" in Apple Home

### How to Enable Server Mode

1. **Create a new bridge** in the Matter Hub web interface
2. **Enable "Server Mode"** checkbox in the bridge creation wizard
3. Add **only your vacuum** to this bridge (Server Mode supports exactly 1 device)
4. **Pair the new bridge** with Apple Home or Alexa
5. Your other devices stay on your regular bridge(s)

:::{note}
Server Mode bridges can only contain **one device**. This is a Matter protocol requirement for standalone devices.
:::

### After Enabling Server Mode

- Your vacuum will appear as a native Matter device (not bridged)
- Siri voice commands like "Hey Siri, start the vacuum" will work
- Alexa will discover and control the vacuum
- Room selection via Service Area will work in Apple Home

## Room Selection

Room selection is supported through two mechanisms:

### 1. RVC Run Mode (Google Home, Alexa, etc.)

Custom cleaning modes are created for each room, e.g., "Clean Kitchen", "Clean Living Room". These appear as selectable modes in compatible controllers.

### 2. Service Area Cluster (Apple Home)

Apple Home uses the Matter 1.4 **Service Area** cluster for room selection. This is automatically enabled when your vacuum exposes room data.

## Room Data Requirements

For room selection to work, your vacuum integration must expose room data as entity attributes. Supported formats:

```yaml
# Format 1: Direct array
rooms:
  - id: 1
    name: Kitchen
  - id: 2
    name: Living Room

# Format 2: Segments array
segments:
  - id: 1
    name: Kitchen
  - id: 2
    name: Living Room

# Format 3: Dreame nested format
rooms:
  "My Home":
    - id: 1
      name: Kitchen
    - id: 2
      name: Living Room
```

## Apple Home & Alexa Limitations

Apple Home and Alexa have specific limitations with robot vacuums over Matter:

### Why Bridged Vacuums Don't Work

Both Apple Home and Alexa expect robot vacuums to be **standalone Matter devices**. When exposed through a bridge (with `BridgedDeviceBasicInformation` cluster), they:

- **Apple Home**: Shows "Updating", Siri commands fail, room selection doesn't work
- **Alexa**: Doesn't discover the vacuum at all

### Solution: Use Server Mode

**Server Mode** is the recommended solution. See [Server Mode](#server-mode-recommended-for-apple-home--alexa) above for setup instructions.

:::{tip}
Server Mode was added specifically to fix these issues. It exposes the vacuum as a native Matter device without the bridge wrapper, making it fully compatible with Apple Home and Alexa.

## Supported Integrations

Room selection works with any integration that exposes room data as attributes:

| Integration | Room Attribute | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Roborock | `rooms` or `segments` | Native support |
| Dreame | `rooms` | Nested format with map name |
| Xiaomi | `rooms` | May require custom integration |
| Ecovacs | `rooms` | Varies by model |

### Dreame Integration Note

The Dreame integration exposes room data in a nested format. As of version 1.x-alpha.150+, this format is fully supported.

If your vacuum uses separate `select` entities for room selection instead of attributes, room selection via Matter is not currently supported.

## Troubleshooting

### Rooms not appearing in Apple Home

1. **Re-pair the vacuum**: Remove it from Apple Home and add it again after updating
2. **Check room attributes**: Verify your vacuum has `rooms`, `segments`, or `room_list` in its attributes
3. **Separate bridge**: Try putting the vacuum in its own bridge (see above)

### Room selection not working

1. Check the logs for errors when selecting a room
2. Verify the vacuum integration supports the `vacuum.send_command` service with `app_segment_clean`

### Vacuum not showing in Apple Home

This is likely the bridge limitation issue. Create a separate bridge with only the vacuum.
