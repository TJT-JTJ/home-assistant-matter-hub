## 📝 About

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.

> [!CAUTION]
> Testing versions are **highly unstable** and intended for developers only!
> Features may be incomplete, broken, or removed without notice.

**🏗️ Vision 1: Callback-based Architecture**

Complete refactoring of the behavior system from self-updating to callback-based:

| Old (Legacy) | New (Vision 1) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Behaviors update themselves via `reactTo(homeAssistant.onChange)` | Endpoint updates behaviors via `setStateOf()` |
| Behaviors call HA actions directly | Behaviors notify endpoint via `notifyEndpoint()` |
| Endpoint has no control over behaviors | Endpoint handles all HA action calls |

**New Callback-Behaviors:**
- `OnOffBehavior` - On/Off control for lights, switches, buttons, valves, scenes
- `LevelControlBehavior` - Brightness/level control for dimmable lights, humidifiers
- `LockBehavior` - Lock/unlock for door locks
- `CoverBehavior` - Open/close/position for covers and blinds
- `FanBehavior` - Speed control for fans
- `ColorControlBehavior` - Color and temperature control for lights
- `VacuumRunModeBehavior` - Run mode control for vacuums
- `VacuumOperationalStateBehavior` - Operational state for vacuums

**Updated DomainEndpoints with Vision 1:**
- ✅ SwitchEndpoint, LockEndpoint, CoverEndpoint
- ✅ VacuumEndpoint, ButtonEndpoint, ValveEndpoint
- ✅ SceneEndpoint, HumidifierEndpoint
- ✅ LightEndpoint (OnOff + Dimmable)
- ✅ FanEndpoint

**Benefits:**
- Endpoint has full control over all HA service calls
- Behaviors are simpler and easier to test
- Enables future multi-entity scenarios (nested endpoints, neighbor entity access)
- Clean separation between Matter protocol and HA logic

**🖼️ Bridge Icons in Backup**
- Full backup now includes bridge icons when exporting with identity
- Icons are automatically restored during backup import

Experimental features being actively developed before promotion to alpha.

## 🤖 Robot Vacuum Server Mode

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Important: Apple Home & Alexa require Server Mode for Robot Vacuums</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Problem

Apple Home and Alexa **do not properly support bridged robot vacuums**. When your vacuum is exposed through a standard Matter bridge, you may experience:

- **Apple Home**: "Updating" status, Siri commands don't work, room selection fails
- **Alexa**: Vacuum is not discovered at all

This is because these platforms expect robot vacuums to be **standalone Matter devices**, not bridged devices.

### The Solution: Server Mode

**Server Mode** exposes your vacuum as a standalone Matter device without the bridge wrapper. This makes it fully compatible with Apple Home and Alexa.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new bridge** in the Matter Hub web interface
2. **Enable "Server Mode"** checkbox in the bridge creation wizard
3. Add **only your vacuum** to this bridge
4. **Pair the new Server Mode bridge** with Apple Home or Alexa
5. Your other devices stay on your regular bridge(s)

### Important Notes

- Server Mode bridges support **exactly one device**
- Your vacuum needs its own dedicated Server Mode bridge
- Other device types (lights, switches, sensors) work fine on regular bridges
- After switching to Server Mode, Siri commands like "Hey Siri, start the vacuum" will work

### Documentation

For more details, see the [Robot Vacuum Documentation](https://riddix.github.io/home-assistant-matter-hub/Devices/Robot%20Vacuum/).

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

Add this repository to your Add-on Store:

```
https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
```

Two add-ons are available:
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub** - Stable release
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub (Alpha)** - Pre-release for testing

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name home-assistant-matter-hub \
  --network host \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token \
  ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

For alpha versions, use tag `alpha` instead of `latest`.

## Documentation

Please see the [documentation](https://riddix.github.io/home-assistant-matter-hub) for detailed installation instructions,
configuration options, known issues, limitations and guides.

## Migration from t0bst4r

Migrating from the original `t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub` is straightforward. **Your Matter fabric connections and paired devices will be preserved!**

### Home Assistant Add-on

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into Home Assistant and find your add-on folder
   ls /addon_configs/
   # Look for folder ending with _hamh (e.g., a0c_hamh)
   
   cp -r /addon_configs/*_hamh /config/hamh-backup
   ```

2. **Uninstall the old add-on** (Settings → Add-ons → Uninstall)

3. **Add the new repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
   ```

4. **Install and start the new add-on**, then check the new _hamh folder:
   ```bash
   ls /addon_configs/
   ```

5. **Stop the add-on** and restore your backup:
   ```bash
   cp -r /config/hamh-backup/* /addon_configs/*_hamh/
   ```

6. **Start the add-on again** - your devices should reconnect automatically

### Docker / Docker Compose

Simply change the image from:
```
ghcr.io/t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```
to:
```
ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

Your volume mounts stay the same - no data migration needed.
