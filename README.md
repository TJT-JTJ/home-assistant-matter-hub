## About

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

Add this repository to your Add-on Store:

```
https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
```

Two add-ons are available:
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub** - Stable release
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub (Alpha)** - Pre-release for testing

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name home-assistant-matter-hub \
  --network host \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token \
  ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

For alpha versions, use tag `alpha` instead of `latest`.

## Migration from t0bst4r

Migrating from the original `t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub` is straightforward. **Your Matter fabric connections and paired devices will be preserved!**

### Home Assistant Add-on

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into Home Assistant and find your add-on folder
   ls /addon_configs/
   # Look for folder ending with _hamh (e.g., a0c_hamh)
   
   cp -r /addon_configs/*_hamh /config/hamh-backup
   ```

2. **Uninstall the old add-on** (Settings → Add-ons → Uninstall)

3. **Add the new repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
   ```

4. **Install new add-on** and restore backup before starting:
   ```bash
   ls /addon_configs/  # Find new _hamh folder
   cp -r /config/hamh-backup/* /addon_configs/*_hamh/
   ```

5. **Start the add-on** - your devices should reconnect automatically

### Docker / Docker Compose

Simply change the image from:
```
ghcr.io/t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```
to:
```
ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

Your volume mounts stay the same - no data migration needed.
