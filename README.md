## 📝 About

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.

## 📦 Releases & Branches

| Channel | Branch | Current Version | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Stable** | `main` | v1.7.x | Production-ready, recommended for most users |

| **Testing** | `testing` | v4.0.0-testing.x | ⚠️ **Highly unstable!** Breaking changes, experimental features |

### Semantic Versioning

We use [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automatic versioning:

- `fix:` commits → Patch version bump (1.7.**x**)
- `feat:` commits → Minor version bump (1.**x**.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump (**x**.0.0)

### Which version should I use?

- **Most users**: Use **Stable** (`main` branch) - thoroughly tested
- **Early adopters**: Use **Alpha** (`alpha` branch) - new features, occasional bugs
- **Developers/Testers**: Use **Testing** (`testing` branch) - bleeding edge, expect breakage

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

Add this repository to your Add-on Store:

```
https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
```

Two add-ons are available:
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub** - Stable release
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub (Alpha)** - Pre-release for testing

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name home-assistant-matter-hub \
  --network host \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  -e HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token \
  ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

For alpha versions, use tag `alpha` instead of `latest`.

## Migration from t0bst4r

Migrating from the original `t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub` is straightforward. **Your Matter fabric connections and paired devices will be preserved!**

### Home Assistant Add-on

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into Home Assistant and find your add-on folder
   ls /addon_configs/
   # Look for folder ending with _hamh (e.g., a0c_hamh)
   
   cp -r /addon_configs/*_hamh /config/hamh-backup
   ```

2. **Uninstall the old add-on** (Settings → Add-ons → Uninstall)

3. **Add the new repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
   ```

4. **Install and start the new add-on**, then check the new _hamh folder:
   ```bash
   ls /addon_configs/
   ```

5. **Stop the add-on** and restore your backup:
   ```bash
   cp -r /config/hamh-backup/* /addon_configs/*_hamh/
   ```

6. **Start the add-on again** - your devices should reconnect automatically

### Docker / Docker Compose

Simply change the image from:
```
ghcr.io/t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```
to:
```
ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

Your volume mounts stay the same - no data migration needed.
